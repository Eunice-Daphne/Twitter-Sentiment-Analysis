To Run:

The Obama and Romney models are written in two seperate python files.

(i) Give the corresponding test data path, train data path and the output file path for the ObamaMain.py and RomneyMain.py seperately at the beginning of the code.

(ii) If the WordNet Lemmetizer is not already present with nltk, download it with the following command; 
	>>nltk.download('wordnet')

(iii) In the console, run the program using the following commands for Obama and Romney seperately;
	>>python ObamaMain.py
	>>python RomneyMain.py
      Ignore any warnings.

(iv) The classification results will be generated in the given output path files for Obama and Romney.


NOTE:

(i) All the other implemented models for Romney are given as seperate .ipynb files.
(ii) For Obama, all the models are present in the ObamaMain.py
